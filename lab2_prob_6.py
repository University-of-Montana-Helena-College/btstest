# 6) Write a program that prompts the user for the amount of change (0 â€“ 99) (wholde number) and 
#    calculates the correct (fewest number of coins) whole number of quarters, dimes, nickels 
#    and pennies to return as change. 
#    Hint: Be sure to use a whole number (int) type for all variables.  
#          Use Div (//) and Mod (%) operators.  Do not use multiplication and substraction.
#    Sample run:
#          Enter total change: 87
#          Quarters: 3
#          Dimes: 1
#          Nickels: 0
#          Pennies: 2
