Output literal string
=
Use print function to prompt the user for information, this is output.
example:
```
  print("Enter Car Make: ")
```

Input string
=
Use input function to get information from the user, this is input.
Assign to variable to get the information from the input function to the variable by putting variable name on left of = then the function on the right. 
example:
```
  car_make = input()
```

Another way:

The input function can take (have value passed to it) the prompt.  This will do the prompt and input in one statement.
```
  car_make = input("Enter Car Make: ")
```

Output literal string and variable (concatination)
=
Use the print function to print results.  Use concatination to put strings together.
example:
```
  print("You have a " + car_make + " vehicle.")
```
